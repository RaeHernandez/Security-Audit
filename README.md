# Security Audit – Controls and Compliance Checklist

## Project Overview
This portfolio project, part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, demonstrates a security audit conducted using NIST standards. It includes evaluation of an organization’s cybersecurity posture and compliance with key controls, along with actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Objective
- Assess organizational cybersecurity posture based on IT manager notes and documented practices.  
- Evaluate compliance with NIST cybersecurity controls.  
- Provide clear recommendations to strengthen security posture.

## Key Components
1. **IT Manager Notes and Posture**
   - Documented observations and assessments from the IT manager regarding current security practices.  

2. **Controls and Compliance Checklist**
   - Indicates whether specific NIST-based controls are in place (`Yes`/`No`).  
   - Provides a clear picture of compliance gaps.  

3. **Recommendations**
   - Actionable suggestions based on identified gaps to improve organizational security posture.  
   - Focus on risk mitigation, control implementation, and process improvements.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Risk assessment and compliance evaluation
- Analytical thinking and documentation
- Application of NIST cybersecurity frameworks
- Translating audit findings into actionable recommendations

## Files in Repo
- `BotiumPosture.docx` – IT manager’s notes and posture documentation  
- `Controls_and_Compliance_Checklist.docx` – checklist of controls and compliance status with recommendations  
- `README.md` – project documentation

## Reflection
This activity strengthened my practical understanding of conducting security audits aligned with NIST standards. By combining documented observations with a compliance checklist, I was able to identify gaps and provide actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
